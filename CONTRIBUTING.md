## Development

Run the macOS test suite from the repository root:

```sh
swift test
```

Build the examples independently:

```sh
swift build --package-path Examples/CodableRoutes
swift build --package-path Examples/RoutingCenter
```

The repository's `Makefile` also provides formatting, linting, and platform-specific test targets. Development tool versions are managed through Mint and Homebrew files in the repository.

## Maintainers

The documentation sources remain in this repository. The [central documentation repository](https://github.com/modern-swift-dev/docs) builds and publishes them daily at [the module documentation site](https://modern-swift-dev.github.io/docs/pathways-swift/). Publish a GitHub release to update the release information on the next scheduled build; publishing is configured in the central repository.

To build and review documentation locally:

```sh
make site-setup
make site-build
make site-validate
make site-preview
```

The build fetches the latest published release, builds the Astro pages and static DocC reference, and checks internal links. Generated HTML is written to `.build/site/` and is ignored by Git. Commit documentation source changes only.
